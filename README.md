# Apache Airlines Seat Booking System

## Overview
This project is a Python-based seat booking system designed for Apache Airlines' new fleet of Burak757 passenger jets. It allows users to check seat availability, book seats with a unique booking reference, free up reserved seats, view the current booking state, and retrieve booking details through a simple command-line interface.

## Features
- **Check Seat Availability:** Check if a specific seat is available for booking.
- **Book a Seat:** Book available seats and enter user details, including passport number, first name, and last name. Each booking generates a unique booking reference.
- **Free a Seat:** Cancel a booking and free up a seat. This also deletes the associated booking details to maintain privacy.
- **Show Booking State:** Displays the current booking status of all seats.
- **Show Booking Details:** Retrieve and display booking details using the booking reference.

## How to Run
Ensure you have Python installed on your system. Clone the repository, navigate to the project directory, and run the script using the command:

```bash
python system_booking.py
